# SF_color_assignment
This package assigns single-molecule identities based on the salvaged fluorescence approach.

# Current version
  - 1.0

# Requirements
  - Microsoft Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit
  - Matlab R2017b or newer  
    - Curve Fitting Toolbox
    - Optimization Toolbox
    
# Installation
  - Download and install Matlab of the right version (30-60 min)
  - Download the code to your computer (a few seconds)
  - Start Matlab and run the code
  
# How to run
example1.m: this example shows how to estimate the photon number in the salvaged fluorescence channel.

example2.m: this example shows how to perform color assignment based on the photon numbers in the conventional and salvaged fluorescence channel.

# Optional step
Conventional_fitting.m: this script shows how to perform single-molecule fitting in the conventional fluorescence channel and estimate the positions and photon numbers. It saves the fitting result as "data_example1.mat", which will be loaded in example1.m. If the fitting result does not exist, it will run this script automatically to generate the data. 

The optional step uses a GPU single-molecule fitter from "fit3Dcspline"(https://github.com/jries/fit3Dcspline; https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4661)

The GPU fitter requires:
  - Microsoft Windows 7 or newer, 64-bit
  - CUDA capable graphics card, minimum Compute Capability 3.0
  - CUDA 8 compatible graphics driver (for GeForce products 378.66 or later)

# Data required
An example two-color dataset of a COS-7 cell imaged with the salvaged fluorescence approach. 

Download the dataset from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qw18jf3qcma1pbj/AACVAfhZ0WxM87vW-5VgrvIaa?dl=0
  - Raw images (3000 frames):  
    - Conventional_fluorescence.tif: images in the conventional fluorescence channel, acuiqred by a sCMOS camara
    - Salvaged_fluorescence.tif: images in the salvaged fluorescence channel, acuiqred by an EMCCD camara
  - Fitting results:
    - data_example1.mat: this is the fitting result of "conventional fluorescence.tif", generated by running "Conventional_fitting.m"
    - data_example2.mat: this is the analyzed result (provided by the authors) of the full dataset (150,000 frames) that used in example2.m to perform color assignment and reconstruction 

Additonal information of the dataset
  - Labeling: 
    - Channel 1: overexpressed GFP-Sec61b labeled with anti-GFP primary antibody and CF660C conjugated secondary antibody
    - Chennel 2: anti-a-tubulin primary antibody and AF647 conjugated secondary antibody
  - Imaging conditions: 
    - 200 fps 
    - 642 nm laser at 15 kW/cm2 
    - only the lower objective was used to collect the fluorescence

# Testing enviroments
  - Microsoft Windows 10 64-bit
  - Matlab 2017b
  - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti
  - CUDA v4.2

# Run time
  - Conventional_fitting.m: 35 seconds
  - example1.m: 11 seconds
  - example2.m: 115 seconds

# Expected output
  - Conventional_fitting.m: this script saves the fitting result as "data_example1.mat" 
  - example1.m: this script will display a scatter plot showing the intensity of of single molecules in the conventional and ssalvaged fluorescence channels. The plot is similar to Fig. 1D in the manuscript.
  - example2.m: this script will display a bined 2D intensity histogram of AF647 and CF660C (similar to Supplementary Fig. S4G) and the overlaid image of ER and microtubules (the same data shown in Supplementary Fig. S13D).
